AI Diagnose Feature Setup

The AI Diagnose feature requires an Anthropic API key.

### For Employers/Reviewers:
If you'd like to test the full AI functionality:

1. Get a free API key at: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Open `index.html` in a text editor
3. Find line ~400 (search for "x-api-key")
4. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your key
5. Save and open in browser

**Note:** API calls cost ~$0.003 per analysis. Testing 10-20 listings will cost under $0.10.

Alternatively, I'm happy to provide a live demo/video for our interview.
